    <h1> Classic Hagis </h1>
    <hr />
    <p> A classic recipe from <i>Foodies</i></p>
  </div>
  <div class=ingredients>
  
    <h2> INGREDIENTS </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ox bung</li>
      <li>1.4kg lamb's pluck, (heart, lungs and liver)</li>
      <li>500g of beef, or lamb trimmings or stewing steak</li>
      <li>200g of suet</li>
     <li>500g of oatmeal, (coarse)</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class=instructions>
  
    <h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe</li>
      <li> Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours </li>
      <li>Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool
    </li>
      <li> 
        Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500–1l of stock. Leave to cool</li>
      <li>Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings. Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices</li>
      <li> Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck, and make up to 1l with cold water. When cool, add to the haggis mixture</li>
      <li> To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2–3 minutes and taste. Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed</li>
      <li>Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung. Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely, and keep a little bung at each end
    </li>
      <li> When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors</li>
      <li>
        
        Tie the new end of the bung, and continue stuffing. Freeze any spare haggises </li>
      <li>Before cooking, pierce the haggis several times with a needle. Place in a pan of cold water, and bring to the boil. Simmer for 1.5–2 hours. When ready, the internal temperature should read at least 74°C</li>
      <li> Serve with mashed potatoes and swede. Or neeps and tatties</li>
    </ol>
