  </div>
  <div class=ingredients>
  
    <h2> INGREDIENTS </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 small chicken breasts (pounded into flat cutlets)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>1 egg    </li>
      <li>3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
     <li>1 medium onion (halved and thinly sliced)</li>



     <li>1 small bunch spring onions (finely sliced)</li>
     <li>pickled ginger (for garnish) </li>
     <li>Seaweed rice seasoning (for garnish)</li>


<h> sauce </h>

<ol>
     <li>1 cup freshly boiled water</li>
    <li>2 cups gruyere cheese (coarsely gated)</li>
    <li>2 tsp Hondashi</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Japanese soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sake</li>
    <li>3 tsp sugar   </li>
    <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 cup Japanese white rice (I love Nishiki rice!)</li>


</ol>


    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class=instructions>
  
    <h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a coating station! 1 small bowl of flour, another of egg and the last one of panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Take a chicken cutlet and press into the flour on both sides. Shake off any excess flour then dip into the egg to coat fully. Shake off the excess egg then place into the panko. Press firmly to fully coat the chicken on both sides. Set onto a plate while you repeat the process with the second cutlet. Place the chicken in the fridge for 30 minutes. This time to dry will stop the breadcrumbs falling off when you fry the chicken. Discard the leftover coating ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan until rippling hot, but not smoking. Carefully slide in each chicken cutlet and fry for 4 minutes each side until fully cooked (depending on the thickness). Drain on paper towels and set aside.</li>
      <li>Cook the rice gently in 4 cups of simmering water until all the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat. Cover with a clean tea towel, then a lid and set aside.</li>
      <li>To make the katsudon, you'll need 2 small frying pans as you'll be making each portion separately but at the same time! You can also buy special Katsudon frying pans (see link in recipe introduction)</li>
        <li>To make the seasoning sauce combine the Hondashi mix with the hot water and stir to dissolve. Mix with all the other seasoning sauce ingredients and set aside.</li>
        <li>Break two eggs into two bowls and beat. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Divide the the onions equally between the two frying pans. Pour over half the seasoning sauce into each pan. Turn on the heat and bring each pan to a light simmer. Pop over a lid and let the onions cook gently for 5-6 minutes until soft.</li>
     <li>Take your cutlets and slice each one into 1 inch slices. Leave the cutlets in their original shape as you carefully place them on top of the simmering onions. put the lids back on and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
     <li>Pour the beaten egg over each cutlet and return the lids. Let the eggs cook for 1-2 minutes before removing from the heat.  </li>

    </ol>
