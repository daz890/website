    <h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
    <ol>
 <li>
    Gather the ingredients.


    <li>
        Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
    </li>

    <li>
            Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>

        <li>

        Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water

        </li>

    <li>
    Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

</li>
 


<li>
 Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.
</li>
   


<li>
        Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.
</li>
        


<li>
            Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the oil and drain. Keep to one side.
            </li>
         <li>

            Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.
         </li>
         <li>
            Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.
         </li>


         <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.</li>

         <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.</li>
          <li>Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.

          </li>
<li>
 Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.

</li>
    </ol>
